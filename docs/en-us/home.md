# Mvp24Hours
This project was developed to contribute to the rapid construction of services. I used the reference of solutions for building microservices.

## Features
* Relational database (SQL Server, PostgreSql and MySql)
* NoSql database (MongoDb and Redis)
* Message Broker (RabbitMQ)
* Pipeline (Pipe and Filters pattern)
* Documentation (Swagger)
* Mapping (AutoMapper)
* Logging
* Standards for data validation (FluentValidation and Data Annotations), notification (Notification pattern) and specifications (Specification pattern), unit of work, repository, among others.

## Samples
You can study different solutions with the Mvp24Hours library. Also, create quick projects using templates for Visual Studio 2019 and 2022.

## Next Steps

* Implement request with HttpFactory to apply resilience concepts;
* Implement request with Consul (Service Discovery) using service key;
* Create http log for monitoring unique resources;
* Create project template using Consul (Service Discovery);
* Create project template integrated with ElasticSearch (ELK);
* Create project model with identity;
* Create project model with dynamic generation of classes with [Mvp24Hours-Entity-T4](https://github.com/kallebelins/mvp24hours-entity-t4);
* Record training videos for the community;
